# 🧠 yo-GPT

**Run powerful open-source LLMs locally — with full transparency and privacy.**

<br />

## 🚀 What is yo-GPT?

Using GPT models often means choosing between:

- Paying for expensive monthly subscriptions
- Or using free tools that track your data

I built **yo-GPT** to change that.

**yo-GPT** is a simple boilerplate to run open-source LLMs locally on your machine, powered by [Fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai). You only pay for what you use — no subscriptions, no hidden fees — and all your data stays local and private.

<br />

## 🔑 Key Features

✅ **Local-first:** Your conversations are saved on your machine.  
✅ **Transparent pricing:** Pay-as-you-go. See exactly what each conversation costs.  
✅ **Powered by open-source LLMs:** Access top-tier models via Fireworks.ai.  
✅ **Easy setup:** Get up and running in minutes.
